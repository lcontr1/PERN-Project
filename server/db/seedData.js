    {title: 'Classic Kitchen Stool', author: 'Charles Durfee', description: 'This comfortable, well-proportioned stool is based on a basic Windsor form, with a thick plank seat and attached legs and back pieces. The seat is sculpted for comfort, and a curved low back gives support to the sitter. The legs are attached with wedged through-tenons, as are the lower stretchers. All the turned parts are shaped with a gentle swell and taper. The bent-laminated back is a bonus from classic Windsor construction, and adds a technique well worth learning to this project.', difficulty: 'medium' , video:'', planswebsite: 'https://finewoodworking.com/2023/04/10/build-a-classic-kitchen-stool' },
